# üè° IoT Home Automation System

This project demonstrates a complete **IoT-based home automation system** that allows users to control home appliances remotely through a web interface. It is built using **Arduino Programming** and devices are connected via **ESP32**

## üöÄ Features

- Control home appliances remotely via web or mobile.
- Real-time monitoring of appliance status.
- Integration with sensors (temperature, motion, etc.) for automated control.
- Customizable timer for scheduling appliance operations.
- Secure authentication for user access.
- Mobile-friendly user interface for ease of use.

All the devices are not necessary, to implement the same as the above demo video i recommend to use all the devices with Precaution and considering all the safety measures.

## üìú How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Upload the code to your **ESP32** using **Arduino IDE**.
3. Click on **Tools** and set the **Partition Scheme** to **RainMaker**.
4. Set the **Upload Speed** and **Baud Rate** to **11520**
5. Compile the code by clicking on the **Verify** button on the Top Left Corner.

I encountered some problems while compiling my code, so if you encounter same problems than I am providing you some articles to solve those problems.
1. https://github.com/SensorsIot/Bluetooth-BLE-on-Arduino-IDE/issues/3

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Setup

1. After successful compile **Upload** the code by clicking on the button next to **Verify**.
2. After successful uploading the code you might not see any output in the console, to view output click on **Serial Monitor**.
3. Go to **Tools** and click on **Serial Monitor**.
4. You will see a **QR Code** and a link to the QR Code.
5. Download the **ESP RainMaker** Mobile Application and Scan the **QR Code**. Further Proceses are mentioned in the ****ESP RainMaker Mobile Applicaion****.
